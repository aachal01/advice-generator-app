## My Process

I created a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure, the CSS styles the elements, and the JavaScript fetches advice from an API and updates the display accordingly when a button is clicked.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/advice)

## What I Learned

- Fetching data from an API using JavaScript.
- Manipulating the DOM to update content dynamically based on API responses.
- Implementing basic styles using CSS to create an appealing UI, including the use of CSS variables.
- Utilizing Google Fonts to enhance typography.
- Utilizing asynchronous functions in JavaScript to handle API requests.
